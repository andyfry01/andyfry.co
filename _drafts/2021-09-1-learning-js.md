"Hi sorry completely off topic but when you were learning programming/JavaScript. When did that lightbulb moment come when you finally started to understand? I'm trying to learn JavaScript/react/react native but I keep getting overwhelmed and nothing seems to be sticking. Any help would be greatly appreciated"


Hey! Not a problem at all, I'd be glad to share some thoughts. 

The lightbulb moment for me was elusive to be honest. I never felt very confident in the first couple years of my programming journey, and was frequently frustrated. I could make the computer do what I wanted it to do, but the code never seemed "right," you know? I'd say when I really started to become confident with JS and programming in general is when I discovered the programming style that suited me best and directed my learning efforts towards that style, and that style is functional programming.

It's tough to get oriented in the JS world, because the language is "multi-paradigm." Languages like Haskell or Erlang are super mathematical and based all around functional programming, so if you're going to get a program to run at all then you have to program in an FP style. Languages like C++ and Java are object oriented, so if you want your stuff to run you'll be writing and "thinking with" objects and methods. 

But JS, being multi-paradigm, enables you to write both OO-style code and FP-style code. This gives you a lot of freedom, but that freedom can be overwhelming, because you don't have any helpful guardrails to direct your thinking. Kind of like the distinction between paint by numbers vs. handing someone a blank sheet of paper and a pen and telling them to just draw something. Blank sheets can be awesome, but they can be stressful too.

There's also a lot of JS learning material out there which emphasizes one style over the other, or even mixes styles, so if you're just bouncing from tutorial to tutorial without a clear understanding of the OO-style or FP-style, you're kinda left scratching your head and wondering which way is the "right way" to do things.

So! I would recommend the following for you: 

1. Hold off on learning React until you're strong with JS fundamentals. React is a huge step up from JS, and if you're trying to learn both from scratch at the same time then you're going to get massively frustrated. React Native especially is crazy to start with! I love that you can build a native app with React, but good god ... You're gonna be grappling with React errors, JavaScript errors, Java errors and Objective C errors all at the same time while trying to learn the basics. This is not the way. 
2. Pick some basic courses and teachers and start learning with them, or a physical book. Reading random blogs and tutorials is a tough way to get oriented and make progress, so I really like learning things in an organized course structure. Wes Bos has some great beginner courses: [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/) and [Beginner JavaScript](https://beginnerjavascript.com/). [You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) is a popular one too.
3. After you're confident with the basics, you can start to pick a programming style. I'm a big proponent of FP, so I'm going to be a little bit evil and direct you down that path ðŸ˜ˆ. [This video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0zVEGEvSaeEd9hlmCXrk5yUyqUag-n84) from FunFunFunction is great for learning FP basics, and [Professor Frisby's Mostly Adequate Guide to Functional Programming](https://mostly-adequate.gitbook.io/mostly-adequate-guide/) is a great intermediate ebook. 
4. React would be good to learn alongside functional programming, seeing as it's based around FP concepts like functional purity and reactivity. Wes Bos, again, has a [React course](https://reactforbeginners.com/) which I'd recommend, and his frequent collaborator Scott Tolinski also has a [beginner React course](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/react-for-everyone).

Good luck! It can be tricky to get started with this stuff, there's a lot to know. But [sucking at something is the first step towards being kinda good at something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smgQiGABQMs).
